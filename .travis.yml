# it looks as if packages are restored from CRAN rather than the renv.lock file; may need to indicate renv.lock file in renv::restore
# could re-introduce cache: packages
# travis_wait  before sudo apt-get works, but creates a log file that then results in a note in the R build (in any case, step only takes a few seconds)
# make sure to match R and BiocManager versions and to update renv (renv::snapshot())
# build without vignettes/manual only refers to dependencies, R package is built fully
