\title{Get the taxonomy given OTU names and lineage information}
\usage{
getTaxonomy(selected = c(), lineages, level = "class",
  useRownames = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected}{a character vector of selected OTU identifiers}

\item{lineages}{a lineage table}

\item{level}{the taxonomic level (domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus or species)}

\item{useRownames}{match OTU identifiers to row names instead of the first column (in this case, taxonomic levels are assumed to range from column 1 to 7)}
}
\value{
the taxonomy of the OTUs
}
\description{
The lineage information is provided in form of a matrix,
which contains for each OTU identifier the taxonomic levels from column
2 to 8 (domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) and the entire
lineage in column 9. The lineage in column 9 is optional.
Alternatively, OTU identifiers can also be stored as column names.
In this case, taxonomic levels are assumed to range from column 1 to 7.
To differentiate between these two formats, set useRownames to false or true.
