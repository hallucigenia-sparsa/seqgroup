\title{Gut taxon abundances from Flores et al.}
\format{
An object of class \code{matrix} (inherits from \code{array}) with 323 rows and 637 columns.
}
\usage{
data(floresgut_taxa)
}
\value{
Taxon x sample matrix of size 323 x 637
}
\description{
Data were obtained through 16S sequencing (V4 region) of faecal material.
}
\details{
OTU abundances were downloaded from QIITA in Nov 2020 (ID: 2151). Control and non-gut samples, samples with less than 10000 reads,
with a mislabel chance above 50% or no mislabel data were removed. Samples belonging to subjects with less than 6 samples
were also removed. Samples were rarefied to 10000 reads and OTUs were aggregated to genus level. OTUs without a known genus were summed into
a garbage taxon named sumUnknown. Samples were ordered first by subject and then by time (week number).
