\usage{
groupBarplot(
  abundances,
  groups = c(),
  aggregate = "none",
  taxon.color.map = NULL,
  group.color.map = NULL,
  topTaxa = 10,
  sortGroupwise = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{abundances}{a matrix with taxa as rows and samples as columns}

\item{groups}{group membership vector with as many entries as samples}

\item{aggregate}{if groups are given, plot the aggregate across the group (or its selected samples if randSampleNum is true); possible values: none, median and mean}

\item{taxon.color.map}{map of taxon-specific colors, should match row names; taxa not present in the color map will be colored in summedTaxonColor}

\item{group.color.map}{map of group-specific colors, should match group names}

\item{topTaxa}{number of top taxa to be plotted}

\item{sortGroupwise}{if true, samples are sorted according to groups}

\item{group.order}{if a vector with group names (one for each group) is given, group samples will be sorted in the order indicated}

\item{hide.taxa}{do not consider these taxa as top-abundant taxa, but keep them among Others}

\item{randSampleNum}{if larger 0, sortGroupwise is set to true and the indicated sample number is randomly selected for each group}

\item{summedTaxonColor}{the color of the summed taxa, by default gray}

\item{extendTaxonColorMap}{if true, taxa not in the taxon color map are added there and the extended color map is returned}

\item{legend}{add a legend with the color code}

\item{legend.shift}{increase/decrease this parameter to shift the color legend further to the right/left}

\item{legend.hidegroups}{do not show the group memberships in the legend}

\item{\\dots}{Additional arguments passed to plot()}
}
\value{
if extendTaxonColorMap is true, the taxon color map is returned
}
\description{
Sort taxa by summed abundance across all samples and plot sorted taxon composition with a bar per sample
}
\details{
Taxa are always sorted across all samples, also in the presence of a group membership vector.
}
\examples{
data(ibd_taxa)
data(ibd_metadata)
# taxon abundances were prefiltered and therefore do not add up to 1
groupBarplot(ibd_taxa,groups=as.vector(ibd_metadata$Diagnosis),randSampleNum=7)
data(ibd_lineages)
ibd_genera=aggregateTaxa(ibd_taxa,ibd_lineages,taxon.level = "genus")
groupBarplot(ibd_genera,groups=as.vector(ibd_metadata$Diagnosis),randSampleNum=7)
