\title{Compute evenness using Sheldon's index}
\usage{
sheldon(x, correction = TRUE, N2N1 = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of species abundances}

\item{correction}{whether or not to apply the correction described in Alatalo, Oikos 37, 199-204, 1981}

\item{N2N1}{whether to compute Sheldon's evenness as the ratio of e raised to the power of H (H = Shannon diversity) and Simpson's diversity}
}
\value{
Sheldon's evenness
}
\description{
Sheldon's index is defined as \eqn{S=\frac{e^H}{N}}, where H is the Shannon diversity and N the species number.
It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 signifies a perfectly even abundance distribution.
}
\details{
Note that the N2N1 mode results in evenness smaller than 1 for equal taxon probabilities.
